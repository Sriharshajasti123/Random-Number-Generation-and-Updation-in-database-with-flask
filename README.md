# Random-Number-Generation-and-Updation-in-database-with-flask


This is a web application which is designed in python flask and SQLalchemy database with all validations.
 In this website , User can registered and then do login with credentials and after fill correct details it shows your name, id and a random number.
i have connected my database app_assign through xampp which is created in phpmyadmin.
I have updated tag_id attribute with random number when we login or reload.
We can check in phpmyadmin whether it is updated or not by reloading.
I have kept a logout button to logout in the end.
